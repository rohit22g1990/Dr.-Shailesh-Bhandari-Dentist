                <h2><strong>When is Dental Crown needed?</strong></h2>
                <p>Dental crowns are used as caps on missing or fractured tooth to protect the life of your teeth. Dental Crowns are needed to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protect or restore a tooth from fracturing due to accident or trauma</li>
                    <li>Replace a tooth which is too large for a filling</li>
                    <li>Get a cap over Implant placed</li>
                    <li>Restore the tooth on which RCT was performed</li>
                    <li>Cover discolored, misshaped or badly formed tooth</li>
                    <li>Require a bridge in that case crowns are a must</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, Dental Crown gives your tooth the strength, shape, size and help to improve the appearance of your tooth. If your dentist has advised, you to get a crown and you are delaying the process then there are chances that you can damage your tooth to the extent that extraction is the last resort.</p>
                <p>Moreover, not getting a dental crown can wear down other adjacent teeth causing damage.</p>
                <h2><strong>What are various types of Dental Crowns?</strong></h2>
                <p>Dental Crowns can be made in variety come in various materials such as:</p>
                <h6>Metal Crowns</h6>
                <p>If someone is looking for long term and the durable solution then metal crowns are to the rescue. The gold crowns in these are the most used and bonds well with the tooth. These can even withstand hard chewing forces and biting. Being stronger they last longer and do not wear down easily. The only drawback is that they are visible from a distance hence, suitable only for molars.</p>
                <h6>Porcelain-fused-to-metal</h6>
                <p>If you have aesthetic concerns and also wish to have metal crowns inserted then these are the best option available. The inside of the teeth is made up of metal and the outer portion of the crown is made of porcelain, as a result, it has the dual advantage – metal which provides strength and porcelain which matches with the color of the teeth making it look like natural teeth. They look the most like natural teeth.</p>
                <h6>Ceramic Crown</h6>
                <p>If you do not want to have metal inserted inside your mouth but want the strength to match metal crowns then ceramic crowns are the best option available. Not only is the strong but blends more naturally with your tooth color making it unnoticed. It does not have any aesthetic concerns and is the best option for the front, back and even for the bridges. The problem of porcelain wearing down and metal being visible is solved by this Dental Crown. They may not be considered as an option for molars because forces applied while biting can wear down your teeth.</p>

                <p>Dental Crowns carry a lot of myths with them a few of them are:</p>
                <h6>Dental Crowns do not look natural</h6>
                <p>There is a misconception that dental crowns do not match with your teeth hence give the impression of an artificial tooth. However, with changes in technology crowns come in various material which looks exactly like your natural teeth. And even metal crowns are a good and viable option because they are used as molars and are never seen.</p>
                <h6>Crowns last forever</h6>
                <p>Though the crowns are now stronger and have longevity, yet they cannot last a lifetime. It also depends as to how well they are taken care of. To ensure they last longer visit your dentist after every 6 months, your dentist will monitor your crown and will replace it timely.</p>
                <h6>Food and Beverage stains the crown</h6>
                <p>The biggest myth that people carry. They believe that food and beverages can stain their teeth with time but in reality, the crowns are made of porcelain and ceramic which do not stain easily.</p>
                <h6>Only used for restorative dentistry</h6>
                <p>People believe that one gets crown only if they have fractured tooth, have undergone <a href="https://clovedental.in/specialties/root-canal-treatment/">root canal treatment</a> or have broken or chipped a tooth. But the truth is they are used in <a href="https://clovedental.in/specialties/smile-makeover/">cosmetic dentistry</a> as a way to enhance the appearance and to have a whiter and beautiful smile.</p>
                <h6>Dental Crowns do not break or chip</h6>
                <p>Though ceramic and porcelain are harder substances yet if you bite on something extremely hard, or face accident or trauma then your crown may break.</p>
                <h6>You cannot get cavity with crowns</h6>
                <p>Because crown covers your tooth, therefore, they become vulnerable to decay. Though crowns, as they are artificial, have no chances of decay yet the part below them can decay. It is, therefore, required to keep your teeth and the area around clean to prevent a cavity.</p>
